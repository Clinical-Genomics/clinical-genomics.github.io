Clinical Genomics Stockholm is an infrastructure for providing state-of-the-art molecular analysis using next-generation sequencing of patient samples from routine clinical care.

The facility is utilising Illumina sequencing technology (HiSeq 2500) to carry out large-scale analyses of the human genome and transcriptome, including large targeted panels, exomes and whole genomes.
